# communityxmas
"Community Xmas" brings together neighbourhoods through a community owned RGB LED display.

# core concept
Local community members can 'claim' one or more LEDs on an RGB led strip. The goal is to engage local communities in the 'aesthetic' of their local christmas decoration. The system uses a mobile friendly website, which is linked to the particle.io cloud. Using a particle device, a sting of individually addressable LEDs is controlled.
